        <h1> Who are we?</h1>
        <p>
            We are three girls who are invested in murdercases and would like to share it with the world. <br>
            We wanna invite everyone to discover underrated cases that have not been solved, <br>
            but also cases that are well known explored with new ways to look at them. <br>
            In 2024 we discovered that all three of us are into true crime and wanted to start a podcast to share all kinds of cases to discuss 
            but also share with others (you guys!)
        </p>
        <p>So take a look and maybe we'll make more than one season! :)</p>

                <p> Hi, I am Donna and some of cases I find interesting are The Albert Fish Case and The Junko Furuta Case, I started getting into true crime after discovering some amazing YouTubers during the COVID lock-down.
                It wasn't something I was "into" before, but just hearing some of these cases I wanted to watch more!

                <p>Hi, I am Mary-Jayne and some of my favorite cases are the Jeffery Dahmer case and the Menendez Brothers case, 
                I started getting into true crime after discovering the cruel story of Jeffery Dahmer. His cruel crimes and the twisted story behind them fascinated me. Since then i've been hooked on discovering new crime cases.
